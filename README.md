# Pseudocompiler

A semi-working implementation of a slightly modified version of OCR's "Exam Reference Language"
(this was formerly known as the "Pseudocode specification"). I say slightly modified, because their
specification is not very clear about a lot of parts of the language (including the type system).

## Installation

You can currently build this from source using `cargo build`, but it is not yet ready for general
usage.

## Roadmap

See <ROADMAP.md> for details.
